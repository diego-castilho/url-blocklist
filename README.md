**Castilho's Personal URL Blocklist**

---

Since I use [**SafeDNS**](https://www.safedns.com) and [**Pi-hole**](https://pi-hole.net) in my Home Network, my intention here is to monitor new DNS blocks on SafeDNS and copy these domains to my block list here and update that on Pi-hole. With this, I'll reduce unnecessary DNS traffic in my ISB Broadband, blocking DNS requests locally on Pi-hole instead of SafeDNS.

SafeDNS will act only as a base to discover new Trackers, Ads, and other malicious URLs throughout the time.
