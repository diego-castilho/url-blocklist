Castilho's Personal URL Blacklist

---

Since I use [SafeDNS][] and [Pi-hole][], my intention here is monitor new blocks on SafeDNS and copy this domains to update my personal block list on Pi-hole. With this I'll reduce unnecessary DNS traffic in my link, blocking domains locally on Pi-hole, instead of SafeDNS.

Throughout the time SafeDNS will act only as a base to discover new Trackers, Ads, and other malicious URLs.


[SafeDNS] https://www.safedns.com "SafeDNS"
[Pi-hole] https://pi-hole.net "Pi-hole"
