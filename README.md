Castilho's Personal URL Blacklist

---

Since I use [SafeDNS][01] and [Pi-hole][02], my intention here is monitor new blocks on SafeDNS and copy this domains to update my personal block list on Pi-hole. With this I'll reduce unnecessary DNS traffic in my link, blocking domains locally on Pi-hole, instead of SafeDNS.

Throughout the time SafeDNS will act only as a base to discover new Trackers, Ads, and other malicious URLs.
